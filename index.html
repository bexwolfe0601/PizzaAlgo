      <p>
        I am a 25 year old, divorced, single mother. My life flipped upside down
        recently in the best way. This course is the start of a new life for
        myself and my son. I used to live in Oceanside, California so I love
        anything related to the ocean including but not limited to surfing,
        swimming, sunsets, bonfires, and great mexican food. Moving up here to
        Idaho, I have discovered new things to enjoy such as the season of fall,
        a supportive community atmosphere, and sledding down snowy slopes with
        my son. I have always been one who lives by a set of processes, I
        suppose that is what drew me to coding. It is appealing to me the sense
        of following rules, and being able to acheive comprehension enough to
        add creativity into my work. This is a new adventure for myself, and I
        am looking forward to where the road ahead leads.

        I looked down at the board. "The <strong>point</strong> isn't to win?" I asked. "The
        <strong>point</strong>," <span>Bredon</span> said grandly, "is to <u>play</u> a <em>beautiful</em> game." He lifted
        his hands and shrugged, his face breaking into a beautific smile. "Why
        would I want to win anything other than a <em>beautiful</em> game?"
